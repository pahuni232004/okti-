2. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** if not already enabled
3. **Go to Google Account Settings**: [myaccount.google.com](https://myaccount.google.com)
4. **Security** â†’ **2-Step Verification** â†’ **App passwords**
5. **Generate App Password** for "Mail"
6. **Copy the 16-character password** (you'll need this)

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables in Netlify

Add these environment variables to your Netlify site:

1. **Go to Netlify Dashboard** â†’ **Site Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**
2. **Add these variables**:

```
EMAIL_USER=your-gmail-address@gmail.com
EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-16-character-app-password
```

EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=abcd efgh ijkl mnop
```

### Step 3: Deploy and Test

1. **Redeploy your site** after adding environment variables
2. **Test a donation** to verify email notifications work

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending?
1. **Check environment variables** are set correctly
2. **Verify Gmail App Password** is correct (16 characters, no spaces)
3. **Check Netlify function logs** for errors
4. **Ensure 2FA is enabled** on the Gmail account

### Test the Email Function
Visit: `https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/send-donation-email`

### Common Issues:
